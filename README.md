# Wifi-AutoConnect
Android App for Android TV box to ensure the Wi-Fi is connected at all times.

The MXQ-Pro Android box I have drops its Wi-Fi all the time and it is annoying to go and connect the Wi-Fi all the time.

This app runs a background service permanently and listens to Wi-Fi changes. If there was no Wi-Fi changes, the alarm will detect no connection in anycase and connect it for you.
